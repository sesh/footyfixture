Fetch the AFL fixture from the official AFL website, then generate a version that only takes a couple of KBs of bandwidth, doesn't include any tracking or betting ads, and includes the whole fixture on one page.

Scores for games in the past are included if they are available. This is _absolutely not_ intended to provide live scores.
